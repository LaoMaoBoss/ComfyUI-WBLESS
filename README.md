# The Nodes
### Set Global Variable
> The `Set Global Variable` node allows you to store your data in variables.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - The `Input` and `Output` nodes form a direct pipeline for better integration within workflows.
> - The `variable data` is used for inputting variable values.
> - `Scope` is used to set the order in which variables are obtained. You just need to connect them in sequence one after another.
> - `variable_name` Here you can set the name of your variable.

>
> - The `Input` and `Output` nodes form a direct pipeline for better integration within workflows.
> - `variable data` is used for outputting the variable's value.
> - `Scope` is used to set the order in which variables are obtained. You just need to connect them in sequence one after another.

### Inversed Switch
> Used to control the direction of the workflow.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - Connect the main workflow to the `Input` interface, then connect the `Output` to different branch workflows. By controlling the `path` value of the node, you can determine which branch the workflow will take.
> - This node needs to be used in conjunction with `Switch`.
> - The core logic of this node draws inspiration from [ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack?tab=readme-ov-file). We would like to express our gratitude to the author of `ComfyUI-Impact-Pack` here.

### Switch
> Select and retrieve data from different processes.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - This node is usually used in conjunction with the `Inversed Switch` node; of course, you can also use it independently.
> - The `Input` interface connects to different branch workflows, while the `Output` interface will output data from the corresponding workflow based on the value of `path`.

> </details> 
### Dominant Axis Scale
> Smart scale input group A relative to input group B, using its longest side as the scaling axis.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - Height a, Width a — these are the input dimensions you need to scale.
> - Height b, Width b — these reference dimensions serve as the scaling baseline, which you can conceptualize as canvas dimensions.
> - ratio — Input your scaling factor here.
> - The output Width, Height, and scale_ratio govern different output formats.

>
> </details>
### Area Based Scale
> Smart scale the area of input group A with reference to input group B, based on size.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - Height a, Width a — these are the input dimensions you need to scale.
> - Height b, Width b — these reference dimensions serve as the scaling baseline, which you can conceptualize as canvas dimensions.
> - ratio — Input your scaling factor here.
> - The output Width, Height, and scale_ratio govern different output formats.
> - cap_threshold — the upper scaling limit threshold, beyond which the object will not scale any.
> - enable_cap — threshold activation switch.

### Area Based Scale (Pixel)
> Smart scale the area of input group A with reference to input group B, based on Pixel.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - The image_alpha port connects to an image with a transparency channel. You may need to use it in conjunction with ApplyMaskToAlpha. Unless you explicitly clear the transparency information of the image, please use it alongside ApplyMaskToAlpha to generate an image with transparency channel information. For specific usage, refer to the ApplyMaskToAlpha section.
> - The image input port is used to connect the background image, or it can be referred to as the reference for scaling.

### Overlay Text & Text Block
> The function of drawing text on images consists of two nodes: a parent node and a child node. The parent node is `Overlay Text`, which is used to control the overall settings, while the child node is `Text Block`, responsible for controlling individual text blocks. These two nodes work together to build a powerful text system with professional-level text adjustment functions.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - The `text_block` input of `Overlay Text` is used to connect `text blocks`. If multiple styles need to be controlled separately, connect multiple `text blocks`.

### Gradient
> Used to generate `gradients` or `transparent gradients` for images.
> <details>
> <summary>See More Information</summary>
>
> - `gradient_type` is used to set the gradient style.
> - `rotation_angle` is used to set the gradient direction.
> - The `position` series settings are used to control the gradient effect in detail.
> - The `color` series settings are used to set gradient colors.
> - The `alpha` series settings are used to set gradient transparency.
> - The `mask` output port will output the corresponding `mask` based on the transparent gradient.
